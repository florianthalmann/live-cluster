This is FAST.4) There is occasional static in both sources.5) The AUD vocals get a little more ""metallic"" at times, but they turned out to be pretty darn good for this matrix.6) There were some tricky spots in syncing these, so I added some extra love.7) This is a HUGE Bobby show. 8) Enjoy!Remastering Notes (05/30/08):1)Portions of ALL songs were re-synced, except Minglewood Blues and Looks Like Rain. This means a HUGE overall improvement - 100's of edits!2)The SBD levels in the encores were increased. They were at lower levels, originally, from the rest of the show.3)The AUD levels during Drums and Space were increased when the SBD is not present. They were just too low before.",MAT

All editing done in CE Pro.  Pitch and volume were matched as closely as possible, crossfades were used on all patches.- Audience noise and tuning just before Loser; a few seconds of tuning from the SBD was deleted since it was just sitting there on its own.- Patched tape flip in Crazy Fingers from 6:28 to 6:42.- Patched tape flip from 6:25 of Drums to the very beginning of Wheel.  AUD had flip at 6:39 of unknown length.  Patch continues through space, 3 sec cross-fade begins just before beginning of Wheel, last of the fade invades < 1 sec of Wheel.- Patched in end of Sugar Magnolia at 9:58.- Patched in crowd noise and tuning at the beginning of Satisfaction, very quick cross-fade to SBD just before 1st note of song.The transition between CDs 1 and 2 is now seamless.  Since I had to edit so many files, I decided I might as well retrack them in CDWave and reencode them as FLAC.  There's a jam at the end of Crazy Fingers that I thought was different enough to warrant its own track.All of the 1st set and the encores were time/pitch stretched to 103% since these tunes were all about a semitone sharp.  There was a bit of tape wow that made it hard to pin the exact pitch, so I made my best guess - it's still a little off, but definitely within tolerance.Many thanks to David Hollister for the SBD source and to Rango Keshavan for the AUD patch source.  Make sure to check it out on LlaMA, it's excellent!Bill Tetzeli (btet@adelphia.net)4:43 AM 11/15/2006------------------------------------------------------------------------------",SBD

There will be some minimal phasing.  The DSBD, while clean, is quite overblown, but my ears did not notice any clipping, although you can see it on the waveform.  The very end of Birdsong is missing from the AUD.  Chunks of Drums and Space were missing from both recordings, but not in the same place, so this recording is complete, except for some crowd noise before the encore that is missing.Caveat: I don't take meticulous notes of every splice and adjustment I make, it's already time consuming enough, but I will explain my process.  Every disc I make is seamless for longer media.  I use the most reliable source, usually whichever is digital, if both are the same generally it's the SBD, and the other sources is time shifted to match that.  With analog sources there is always some wavering.  Within reason I try to adjust for the by making small, millisecond cuts, lining up the drum beats.  These are smoothed over and when mixed with another source, undetectable.  There still may be occasional phasing, particularly in the vocals and the cymbals.  Believe me that I do everything I can to minimize problems like that.  That includes cutting out spots of diginoise and blips and things.  Whenever there is something missing from one source but present on the other, I bring up the volume a tad on the source that's left, to minimize the jarring nature of one source dropping out.  When the crowd noise at the start of a set is less than two minutes or so, I don't make a separate crowd track.  I export the final result to aiff files, and then convert those into flacs at the smallest setting, using xACT for Mac, and that also makes then SBE safe.I hope everyone enjoys the product of my labor, and I'm glad to give something back to the community that has given me and others so much music over the years.  Thanks, brothers and sisters.-Tano (hansokolow@gmail.com)",MAT

This is the SBD source with the songs patched using an upgraded cassette SBD. These patched tunes are also in near perfect condition.  Other than some slight speed flux it was hard to even know these tunes were sourced from a cassette.  The patch job, splice into the DSBD source, was very well done.AUD1 (ShnID = 31211)Nice sounding above average tapers section recording. Made directly to DAT. Nice balanced sound, no flaws and a clean transfer.AUD2 (ShnID = 17704)After a few DSP tweaks (primarily level adjustments and some D'EQ) I found this FOB to be the best of the 3 AUD recordings.  That is why it has the largest % mixed into the stereo matrix and why it has a lion's share mix in the rear channels for the 5.1 versions.AUD3 (ShnID = 443)Another great FOB slightly more ""muddy"" than the other Schoeps source recording.  I believe the 2 FOBs were made in different locations b/c of the overall sound and time travel btwn the kickdrum and the high hat I think AUD2 was a bit closer than thisFOB.  Plus there are different sounds from crowd, cheers, etc.---------------------------------------------------------Tech NotesFLAC/SHNs were decoded to wave.

This happens approx 5 times throughout the show.---------------------------------------------------------Editorial CommentsFun time at these 2 shows.  I drove down during mid-terms weekat URI with myself and 4 very good friends.  We drove my 1967Mercedes 230s - a classic.  We decided on that trip that the carcould shrink or expand to fit our needs.  You didn't really drivethis car, it drove you and you tried your best to negotiate. Ileft a full pack of smokes on the rear bumper of the car and when we stopped again for gas 300 miles later the smokes were still there.  Now that is a boat of a car!A person in our group had family that lived in Virginia and was able to send his brother to venue and buy tickets for us in advance of the show.  A good thing as the first night was a very hard ticket.  Another group of URI friends also made the road tripand did not get into the Saturday night, Oct 8th show.  We stopped by their hotel room but it was not a pretty scene.  Some very disappointed, grumpy folks that had no desire to speak with usabout the great show. The next night, Oct 9th everyone got it.  It was the night for the heads as the weekend warriors left after Saturday's show thinking they'd seen ""the"" show.  Wrong!It was a very cool parking lot scene at Hampton to say the least.  Everyone buzzing over these last minute shows added to the Fall Tour.  Under the original name The Warlocks ta-boot.  The Dupree'shanded out that weekend had an announcement that said somethinglike ""Do you want to hear some oldies?  Get ready, here they come"".  Someone at Dupree's Diamond News obviously had some inside info.",MAT

I say purported because it's extremely clean, and per my ears and comments both on archive and etree it's most likely a board or matrix.  The only flaw is Branford is either very low or missing entirely during space, where in the Miller seed he's very prominent.I used this source to patch in about 15 seconds of missing space between the end of CD 2 and the beginning of CD 3 (1:06-1:20 on the new d3t01) using CE Pro.
